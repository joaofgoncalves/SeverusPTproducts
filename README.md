# SeverusPTproducts repository

Welcome to the SeverusPT project! This repository contains the code libraries developed for the SeverusPT project, which are used to map observed/historical burn severity in mainland Portugal through Google Earth Engine. 

Specifically, this repository implements the pipeline responsible for calculating one part of the data products 
generated in SeverusPT, defined as _"Delta approach"_.

The project is funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology and led by BIOPOLIS/CIBIO/InBIO - Center of Excellence in Environmental Biology, Ecosystem Research, and Agro-biodiversity of the University of Porto, in collaboration with IPVC - Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo.


## Project Description

Despite increasing investments in fire suppression, extreme fire events have become more frequent in Mediterranean Europe, including mainland Portugal. The SeverusPT project addresses this challenge by developing a comprehensive framework for assessing, mapping, and predicting fire severity using satellite-derived indicators of ecosystem functioning related to carbon, water, and energy balance.


## Key Features

- Robust framework: The project implements a spatially explicit framework that assesses, maps, and predicts fire severity, considering the effects of fires on ecosystems under a changing climate.
    
- Satellite data analysis: Spectral and ecosystem functioning indicators extracted through remote sensing are leveraged to assess fire severity and provide detailed characterizations on a large scale.
    
- Web-based services: A user-friendly web service is being developed to provide continuous and standardized fire severity products, facilitating preventive fire risk management, surveillance, and post-fire restoration efforts.


## Main objectives

- Develop a spatially explicit framework to assess, map, and predict fire severity.
    
- Deliver a co-designed product/service that enhances institutional and operational capacity for fire hazard management and post-fire restoration.
    
- Foster collaboration with key stakeholders for long-term sustainability and continuous improvement of the product/service.
    
- Contribute to advancing the state-of-the-art in fire severity mapping and modeling, understanding its driving factors, and its links to fire hazard management.
